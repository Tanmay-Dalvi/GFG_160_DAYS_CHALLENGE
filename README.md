# 160 Days of DSA Challenge

Welcome to the **160 Days of DSA Challenge** repository! üéâ

This repository is dedicated to my journey of solving data structures and algorithms (DSA) problems for **160 consecutive days**. The goal of this challenge is to dive deep into DSA concepts, improve problem-solving skills, and master coding in Python.

## üìÖ **Challenge Overview**

The challenge is designed to be **structured and consistent**, tackling a new problem every day for **160 days**. Each day presents a unique problem related to various topics in DSA, which are solved in Python. From arrays to trees, graphs to dynamic programming, you‚Äôll find a wide variety of problems to keep you engaged and learning.

- **Challenge Duration**: 160 Days
- **Focus**: Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)
- **Language Used**: Python
- **Platform**: GeeksforGeeks (GFG)

## üìù What You‚Äôll Find in This Repository

This repository contains the following:

- **Daily Problem Statements**: A summary of each day's problem, including its context, input/output format, and constraints.
- **Solution Code**: Python solutions to each problem, with explanations to help you understand the approach used to solve them.
- **Learning Resources**: Links to relevant articles, tutorials, or videos that explain important concepts and help reinforce learning.
- **Progress Tracker**: As I progress through the challenge, you‚Äôll be able to track each day‚Äôs problem and the corresponding solution.

## üèÜ Why This Challenge?

- **Structured Learning**: By solving one problem every day, I aim to build and reinforce my understanding of key DSA concepts in a consistent manner.
- **Personal Growth**: This challenge will not only sharpen my technical skills but also help develop problem-solving strategies that can be applied in real-world coding and software development.
- **Community Engagement**: I‚Äôm sharing this repository in hopes that it will help fellow learners and enthusiasts tackle DSA problems with Python. Feel free to fork the repo, contribute, or create issues with suggestions and improvements.
